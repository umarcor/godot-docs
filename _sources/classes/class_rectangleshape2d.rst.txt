Rectangle shape resource for 2D physics.

Description
-----------

2D rectangle shape to be added as a *direct* child of a :ref:`PhysicsBody2D<class_PhysicsBody2D>` or :ref:`Area2D<class_Area2D>` using a :ref:`CollisionShape2D<class_CollisionShape2D>` node. This shape is useful for modeling box-like 2D objects.

\ **Performance:** Being a primitive collision shape, **RectangleShape2D** is fast to check collisions against (though not as fast as :ref:`CircleShape2D<class_CircleShape2D>`).
