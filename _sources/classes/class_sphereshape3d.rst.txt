SphereShape3D
=============

**Inherits:** :ref:`Shape3D<class_Shape3D>` **<** :ref:`Resource<class_Resource>` **<** :ref:`RefCounted<class_RefCounted>` **<** :ref:`Object<class_Object>`

Sphere shape resource for 3D collisions.

.. rst-class:: classref-introduction-group

Description
-----------

3D sphere shape to be added as a *direct* child of a :ref:`PhysicsBody3D<class_PhysicsBody3D>` or :ref:`Area3D<class_Area3D>` using a :ref:`CollisionShape3D<class_CollisionShape3D>` node. This shape is useful for modeling sphere-like 3D objects.

\ **Performance:** Being a primitive collision shape, **SphereShape3D** is the fastest collision shape to check collisions against, as it only requires a distance check with the shape's origin.

.. rst-class:: classref-property

:ref:`float<class_float>` **radius** = ``0.5``

.. rst-class:: classref-property-setget

- void **set_radius** **(** :ref:`float<class_float>` value **)**
- :ref:`float<class_float>` **get_radius** **(** **)**

The sphere's radius. The shape's diameter is double the radius.
