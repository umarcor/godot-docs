**Inherits:** :ref:`Shape3D<class_Shape3D>` **<** :ref:`Resource<class_Resource>` **<** :ref:`RefCounted<class_RefCounted>` **<** :ref:`Object<class_Object>`

Box shape resource for 3D collisions.

.. rst-class:: classref-introduction-group

Description
-----------

3D box shape to be added as a *direct* child of a :ref:`PhysicsBody3D<class_PhysicsBody3D>` or :ref:`Area3D<class_Area3D>` using a :ref:`CollisionShape3D<class_CollisionShape3D>` node.

\ **Performance:** Being a primitive collision shape, **BoxShape3D** is fast to check collisions against (though not as fast as :ref:`SphereShape3D<class_SphereShape3D>`).
