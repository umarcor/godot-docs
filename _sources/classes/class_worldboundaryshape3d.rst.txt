WorldBoundaryShape3D
====================

**Inherits:** :ref:`Shape3D<class_Shape3D>` **<** :ref:`Resource<class_Resource>` **<** :ref:`RefCounted<class_RefCounted>` **<** :ref:`Object<class_Object>`

World boundary (infinite plane) shape resource for 3D physics.

.. rst-class:: classref-introduction-group

Description
-----------

3D world boundary shape to be added as a *direct* child of a :ref:`PhysicsBody3D<class_PhysicsBody3D>` or :ref:`Area3D<class_Area3D>` using a :ref:`CollisionShape3D<class_CollisionShape3D>` node. **WorldBoundaryShape3D** works like an infinite plane and will not allow any physics body to go to the negative side. Note that the :ref:`Plane<class_Plane>`'s normal matters; anything "below" the plane will collide with it. If the **WorldBoundaryShape3D** is used in a :ref:`PhysicsBody3D<class_PhysicsBody3D>`, it will cause colliding objects placed "below" it to teleport "above" the plane.

\ **Performance:** Being a primitive collision shape, **WorldBoundaryShape3D** is fast to check collisions against.
